I am Uzair Shah, a dedicated Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in applying advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in health informatics. Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) in Qatar, I specialize in AI applications in biomedicine. My work focuses on leveraging predictive modeling and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from biomedical data.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with medical institutions and contribute to several peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals. My research interests include machine learning, natural language processing, and health informatics. I have a proven track record of successfully developing AI-based tools for diverse applications, such as brain signal decoding, vaccine sentiment analysis, and fetal health monitoring using ultrasound images.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have also worked as a Data Scientist intern at PanData and as a Lead Technician at Ooredoo, Qatar, applying my skills in real-world settings. My commitment to excellence has been recognized through multiple awards, including first place at the CodeCamp hackathon and third place at the Al-Fikra National Entrepreneurship Competition.

I am passionate about the power of AI to transform healthcare and improve patient outcomes, and I am continuously seeking new challenges and opportunities to contribute to the field.
